      >4. Data Security</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The security of your data is paramount to us. We implement

        commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we
        cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy,
        unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such
        as for tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we no longer
        have an ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
        information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not
        possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored
        in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
        information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
        possible.</p>
