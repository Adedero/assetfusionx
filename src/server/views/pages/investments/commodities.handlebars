        <p class="text-base mb-10">Commodities are raw materials or
          primary agricultural products that can be bought and sold, such as
          oil, gold, silver, grains, and livestock. They are the essential
          inputs for virtually every product and service we consume. Unlike
          manufactured goods, commodities are standardized and interchangeable,
          meaning a barrel of crude oil from Saudi Arabia is essentially the
          same as a barrel from Texas, making them ideal for global trading.</p>

            <p class="text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Commodities
              are broadly categorized into two main groups: <b>hard commodities</b>
              and <b>soft commodities</b>. Hard commodities are natural resources
              that must be mined or extracted, such as gold, oil, and natural
              gas. They are finite and often subject to geopolitical influences
              and supply chain disruptions.</p>
            <p class="text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Soft
              commodities, on the other hand, are agricultural products or
              livestock, like wheat, corn, coffee, sugar, and cattle. Their
              prices are heavily influenced by weather patterns, crop yields,
              and global demand. Both types of commodities play a vital role in
              global trade and investment.</p>

              independently of traditional financial assets like stocks and
              bonds. This low correlation makes them an excellent tool for
              **diversifying your investment portfolio**, potentially reducing
              overall risk and enhancing returns, especially during periods of
              market volatility.</p>

              Hedge</h3>
            <p class="text-base text-slate-400">When inflation rises, the cost
              of raw materials typically increases, which in turn drives up
              commodity prices. This makes commodities a valuable **hedge
              against inflation**, helping to preserve your purchasing power
              when the value of fiat currencies might be eroding.</p>
