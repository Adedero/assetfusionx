        <p class="text-base">Bonds are essentially loans made by
          an investor to a borrower (typically a corporation or government).
          When you buy a bond, you are lending money to the issuer, who, in
          return, promises to pay you back the principal amount (face value) on
          a specific date (maturity date) and usually pays you regular interest
          payments along the way. These interest payments are known as coupon
          payments, and they form the basis of passive income for bondholders.</p>

        <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-12 items-center">
          <div>
            <p class="text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Think of a
              bond as an I.O.U. certificate. Governments issue bonds to fund
              public projects like infrastructure or defense, while corporations
              issue them to finance expansions, research, or operational needs.
              Unlike stocks, which represent ownership in a company, bonds
              represent debt. This makes them generally less volatile than
              stocks, offering a different risk-reward profile.</p>
            <p class="text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Key
              characteristics of a bond include its face value (the amount
              repaid at maturity), coupon rate (the interest rate paid),
              maturity date (when the principal is repaid), and issuer
              (who borrowed the money). Understanding these elements is crucial
              to evaluating a bond's potential return and risk.</p>

              <li><span class="text-primary-500 font-semibold">Capital
                  Preservation:</span>
                At maturity, the investor usually receives their initial
                investment back, making bonds attractive for preserving capital.</li>
              <li><span class="text-primary-500 font-semibold">Lower Volatility:</span>
                Generally, bonds are less susceptible to wild price swings

            <p class="text-base text-slate-400">One of the primary attractions
              of bonds is their ability to provide a predictable and steady
              stream of income. The fixed interest payments (coupons) can be a
              reliable source of passive income, making them ideal for
              retirees or those seeking consistent cash flow from their
              investments.</p>

              Mitigation & Diversification</h3>
            <p class="text-base text-slate-400">Bonds generally have a low
              correlation with stocks, meaning they often perform differently
              under varying market conditions. Adding bonds to a stock-heavy
              portfolio can help reduce overall portfolio volatility and
              risk, providing a cushion during equity market downturns.</p>

            <p class="text-base text-slate-400">For investors prioritizing the
              safety of their principal, bonds are often a preferred choice.
              When held to maturity, the issuer is obligated to return the
              initial investment, making them a relatively safe haven for
              capital compared to more volatile asset classes.</p>

                  generally considered the safest bonds due to the backing of
                  the issuing government's taxing power. They are often used as

                <p class="text-base text-slate-400">Issued by companies to raise
                  capital, these bonds carry a higher risk than government bonds
                  but typically offer higher interest rates to compensate
                  investors for that increased risk. Their creditworthiness

                  attractive to investors in higher tax brackets. Their safety
